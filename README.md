# w4c25_rainfall

This repository contains the implementation developed for the Weather4Cast 2025 competition at NeurIPS, focusing on short-term precipitation nowcasting from satellite data. Our approach employs a two-stage transfer learning pipeline using ConvGRU networks to predict future SEVIRI brightness temperature fields and transform them into rainfall estimates. The models were trained on the BOXI-0015 region for 2019 and fine-tuned for other geographical areas.
